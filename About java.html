 Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. It is renowned for its core principle,"<b> Write Once, Run Anywhere</b>" (WORA), allowing compiled Java code (bytecode) to run on any platform equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM),regardless of the underlying operating system. Java programming code written for one platform, like the Windows operating system, can be easily transferred to another platform, like a mobile phone OS, and vice versa without being completely rewritten. Java works on multiple platforms because when a Java program gets compiled, the compiler creates a .class bytecode file that can run on any operating system that has the Java virtual machine (JVM) installed on it. It's typically easy to install JVM on most major operating systems, including iOS, which was not always the case. </font>

<ol type = "1">
<font size = 4px>
<li>Object-Oriented:<br> Java follows the OOP paradigm, which facilitates software development and maintenance using concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</br></li>

<li>Platform Independent:<br> Java code is compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode, which runs on the JVM. This bytecode can be executed on any operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) that has the JVM installed, making it platform-independent.</br> </li>

<li>Simple:<br> Java was designed to be easy to learn and use. It removes complex features found in languages like C++, such as explicit pointers and operator overloading</br> </li>

<li>Secure:<br>  Java has built-in security features, including automatic garbage collection and bytecode verification, which help prevent memory leaks and reduce vulnerabilities.</br> </li>


<li>Robust:<br>  It is a strong language with excellent memory management (automatic garbage collection) and exception handling, which helps detect errors both at compile time and runtime.</br> </li>


<li>Multithreaded:<br>  Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously within a single program, leading to efficient CPU utilization and improved performance.</br> </li>


<li>High Performance:<br>  While Java is interpreted, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime, which significantly improves the execution speed.</br> </li>


<li>Distributed:<br>  Java is designed for distributed environments, providing features like Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and support for internet protocols (HTTP, FTP), which help in creating network-based applications.</br> </li>


<li>Rich API and Libraries:<br>  Java provides a vast set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and libraries for networking, database connectivity (JDBC), GUI development, and more, which simplifies coding for developers.</br> </li></ol></font>
